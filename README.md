****Joke App**** 

**Description:**

This Node.js application fetches random jokes from the Jokes API ([https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/)) and displays them on a webpage built with Express, EJS, and Axios. It's a simple and fun way to get a quick laugh!

**Features:**

- **Random Joke Delivery:** Uses the Jokes API to retrieve a random joke on each page load.
- **EJS Templating:** Employs EJS templates to render the joke dynamically, providing a user-friendly presentation.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to gracefully handle potential network issues or API unavailability.

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aftabmumtaz123/jokes.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd jokes
   npm install express axios ejs
   ```

**Usage:**

1. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server on port `3000` by default. You can access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.

2. **Get a laugh!**

   Refresh the page in your browser to see a new random joke displayed.

**Additional Notes:**

- This code utilizes EJS for templating. The view template (`jokes.ejs`) is used to render the joke in a visually appealing way. You can customize this template to change the layout and styling.
- The error handling can be further improved for a more robust user experience (e.g., displaying error messages to the user or providing alternative content).
- Consider adding a button or other interaction to fetch a new joke without requiring a full page refresh.

**License:**

(Consider adding a license to your project, such as MIT. This helps clarify how others can use and distribute your code.)

**Credits:**

- Jokes API ([https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/)) for providing random jokes
